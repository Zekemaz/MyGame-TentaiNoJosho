        <p id="gamestory_p">
            In the beginning there was only peace, that peace which
            subsisted for thousands of years among the Chikyujin.
            These people knew how to exploit the resources of their land
            in every corner while respecting it. Everybody
            was united and there was no war. One day a new people came from the sky,
            they called themselves the Tentai.
            <br><br>
            Upon their arrival on Chikyu, some inhabitants welcomed them and considered them
            like deities, superior beings, while others
            filled with jealousy, greed and simple fear of the unknown
            decided to confine themselves in the hidden places of Chikyu. Realizing
            that they were thousands of scared Chikyujin they decided to create the clan of
            Aku'No (Evil). Their goal was to open the eyes of all Chikyu so that they
            could see how much chaos the arrival of the Tentai caused.

            <br><br>The Tentai offered their help only to those in need or those who ask.
            They then chose to train the Chikyujin to teach them their
            magic and power. Over the years only a few
            Chikyujin managed to reach the title of Ten’Nin.
            Reaching their level requires years of practice and training and
            is described by the phrase 'Tentai no Jōshō'.
            As of today no one is asking to be trained and Tentai die day after day
            under the attacks of the Aku'No, whom after years only seek destruction of
            those who disagree with their beliefs.
            <br><br>
            You have to do something and help the Tentai, follow their
            training and become a Ten’Nin, repel the attacks from orchestrated by the
            Aku'No.

            Our survival depends on it!
