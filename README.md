# MyGame-Tentai-No-Josho

During this project my aim was to build a game. The technology I needed to use was one of my choosing. 
I had a few constraints obviously that would impact my choice. 
Those constraints were :
-The need for the player to be able to connect to his her account.
-Being able to chat with your friends
-The need for resources to regenerate
-Being able to attack other players
